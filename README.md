# PEBParsing
PEBParsing parses the environment block of the running process. No Win32 API is being called.

This was a exploring project into including assembly into a c program. Inspiration and concepts taken from [Boku7's whereami](https://github.com/boku7/whereami) BOF.

Will convert this into a BOF too soon.
